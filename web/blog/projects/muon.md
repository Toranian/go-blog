# Muon Design

Muon design is more than just a programming project - it's a long term business that I've been running for about 2 years now, providing hand-crafted websites to clients.

## History

Starting in 2019, Mary Ruth Snyder, the executive director of the Campbell River and Chamber District of Commerce reached out asking for a website. At the time, I was in highschool, and had never done anything like it.

She requested I build her a WordPress site, which I had never worked with before then. Howver, I decided to take on the challenge, and create a website.During my time working for her, I learned a lot about working with a client, and how important it is to define strong requirements from the start of the project.

## Present Day

Currently, the site has been online for more than 5 years, providing businesses within Campbell River a place to learn about their community. Additionally, the site has facilitated over 100 sales through the platform, helping fund the chamber.
